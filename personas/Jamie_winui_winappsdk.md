# Native Windows Dev WinUI and Win App SDK Persona

## Bio

“Jamie” is a developer focused on creating high-fidelity, consumer-oriented experiences on Windows 11. She is familiar with the Fluent Design System and modern UI/UX principles.

## Goals and challenges

Jamie is a software developer who is focused on building high-end Windows desktop apps for the Healthcare industry.

Jamie has been building Windows apps for several years and is familiar with the Fluent Design system, but her previous apps have been built with WinUI 2, so the transition to WinUI 3 is new to her.

Jamie wants to build a brand new Windows desktop app using WinUI 3 and modern Windows App SDK features and assess whether it is necessary or worth-while to update the existing Windows apps that she maintains from WinUI 2 to WinUI 3. Jamie has found it challenging to use WinUI 3 so far due to its different set of core types. She is trying to determine the level of investment that will be required in transitioning to WinUI 3 in order to support her company's high-profile customers and internal Windows apps.

Jamie's number one concern is privacy and the security of the customer healthcare data maintained by her company. She needs to ensure that all data is compliant with HIPPA policies.

Jamie also wants to ensure that her Windows apps deliver true-to-Windows design capabilities, including special materials, animations, and modern controls that look and feel very native to the current Windows operating system that end-users are familiar with, while recognizing that some of her company's older customers may still be using older versions of Windows and older devices and may struggle with change from familiar UI, icons, or confusing features.

Jamie also wants to train and fine-tune a customized ML model on her company's proprietary healthcare data. This is a new endeavor for Jamie and she is unfamiliar with building ML models, so wants to find an existing model structure that she can just integrate her company's data with while maintaining privacy.

Jamie plans to primarily run her new WinUI 3 app locally in on-premesis Windows devices in the healthcare facilities her company runs in order to maintain a secure environment. She plans to implement and test robust security measures to protect the sensitive healthcare data.

Jamie has identified a contract agency that can provide specialized Data Scientists to help her train an ML model on her customer's data and integrate the model into her Windows app if necessary.

Jamie is most familiar with Visual Studio and plans to use it as the IDE. Jamie works exclusively on a Windows device.

## Scenario tasks

1. Jamie needs to learn about the differences between WinUI 2 and WinUI 3 and how those differences will affect her normal workflow and bookmarked documentation references. She is used to working with the standalone WinUI 2 NuGet package in a UWP app environment. She uses C# and C++ in her project code and has used XAML islands in past projects. She needs to learn how to create a new project template that uses WinUI 3 and Windows App SDK. She doesn't quite understand how Windows App SDK differs from Windows SDK either. She has not yet installed Windows App SDK and has been using an older version of Visual Studio 2019.
2. Now that Jamie understands the difference between WinUI 2 and WinUI 3, has installed the Windows App SDK, and has created a project template inside Visual Studio, she needs to know how to design a user interface layout with modern controls.
3. Jamie's team has some shared .NET 8 libraries that will soon be updated to target .NET 9. Jamie wants to ensure that any new WinUI apps they create can use these shared libraries to maximize code reuse. She needs to know how to reference these shared libraries in her new WinUI 3 project.
