# Persona Title: Aspiring C# Developer

## Bio:
Jordan Lee is a recent computer science graduate who is eager to dive into the world of software development. With a solid foundation in programming concepts and a keen interest in learning new technologies, Jordan is currently focused on mastering C#. They have experience with basic programming languages like Python and Java, but are now looking to expand their skill set by exploring the capabilities of C#. Jordan is motivated by the desire to build robust applications and improve their coding proficiency.

## Goals and Challenges:
- **Objectives**:
  - Jordan aims to learn the fundamentals of C# and build a strong foundation in the language.
  - They want to create simple applications to understand the practical aspects of C# programming.
  - Jordan is interested in exploring advanced features of C# to enhance their coding skills.
- **Challenges**:
  - Transitioning from other programming languages to C# and understanding its unique syntax and features.
  - Managing time effectively to balance learning with other commitments.
  - Overcoming initial hurdles in debugging and error handling in C#.

## Scenario Development:
### Basic Scenarios:
1. **Setting up the Development Environment**: Jordan installs .NET SDK and sets up Visual Studio Code to start coding in C#.
2. **Writing the First Program**: Jordan writes and runs the "Hello World" program to understand the basic structure of a C# application.
3. **Exploring Variables and Data Types**: Jordan declares and uses variables to store and manipulate data in C#.

### Advanced Scenarios:
1. **Building a Simple Console Application**: Jordan creates a console application that takes user input and processes it to display customized messages.
2. **Implementing Error Handling**: Jordan learns to handle exceptions and errors in C# to make their applications more robust.
3. **Exploring Object-Oriented Programming**: Jordan delves into object-oriented programming concepts in C#, such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, to build more complex applications.
