## Bio

## Goals and challenges

Morgan maintains multiple WPF apps for his Finance company. He has been asked to integrate some new AI features.

Morgan highly values the reliability and flexibility that using WPF offers the apps that he is responsible for maintaining. He is very familiar with data binding and visualization tools, but is new to AI and has no idea how to include his company's data so that AI can provide more customization for the users of his Finance apps.

Morgan is also feeling frustrated wtih the dated look and feel of his WPF apps. He isn't sure how to bring them up to par with modern looks and standards.

Morgan watched a presentation at the 2024 Microsoft Build conference that talked about Windows Copilot Runtime and Windows Copilot Library. He has concerns about the Recall feature, but is very interested in Phi Silica and it's potential to make his job of integratign AI features into his company's WPF apps easier.

Morgan nees to ensure that the WPF apps he maintains meet Finance industry compliance and security standards, but the data that he works with to make Finance predictions is public data and not under any particular data privacy restriction.

Morgan is most familiar with C# and Python. He uses Visual Studio as his IDE. Jamie works exclusively on a Windows device.
