# Cross-platform Dev .NET MAUI Persona

## Bio

“Alex” is a cross-platform developer who builds apps for both Windows and mobile platforms using .NET. They have experience with Xamarin and are transitioning to MAUI.

## Goals and challenges

Alex is a software developer who wants to build apps that work seamlessly across different platforms, including Windows and Mobile (primarily), but also Mac and Linux.

Most of Alex's experience with building cross-platform apps was using Xamarin, but Alex wants to transition to using .NET MAUI, as they know it is a more modern framework.

Alex wants to build a brand new cross-platform app using .NET MAUI with the top priority of a highly performant native Windows app experience that leverages the capabilities of MAUI.

Alex also wants to ensure the compatibility of features in the web browsers used by IT admins and local devices (Windows and Mac) by the employees of the Enterprise company that they work for.

Alex highly values responsive design and cross-platform functionality and always performs extensive testing before deploying a new cross-platform app. They plan to collaborate with IT admins to test and validate the features of the new app.

After validating that the features work across platforms, Alex wants to optimize the performance speed of the app across the different platforms.

Alex is most familiar with Visual Studio and plans to use it as the IDE. Alex works on a Windows device.

## Scenarios

1. Alex needs to install and set up a .NET MAUI development environment.
2. Alex needs to create the Windows app first but wants to ensure that any features developed can easily be adapted to the iOS and Android platforms.
3. Alex needs to test the Windows, iOS and Android apps while developing with Visual Studio on Windows.

## Advanced scenarios

1. Alex wants the app to call some APIs deployed to an Azure App Service. The app will need to use the current user's Microsoft Entra ID account to authenticate when making the calls. There will likely be many API calls made as the users are using the app, and Alex only wants to prompt the users to authenticate once during their session. The authentication method needs to work on every target platform.
2. Alex wants to migrate one of their team's existing Xamarin.Forms apps to .NET MAUI. The current app only targets iOS and Android, and Alex's team wants the .NET MAUI app to also have a Windows version.
