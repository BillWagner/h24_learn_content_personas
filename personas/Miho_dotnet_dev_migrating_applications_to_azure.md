# Persona: C# Developer Migrating Applications to Azure

## Bio:
Miho Kojima is a highly experienced C# developer with over 10 years of experience building enterprise-level applications using the .NET framework. Miho has a strong background in architecting, developing, and maintaining web applications, especially for large-scale enterprises. Currently, Miho is focused on migrating existing on-premises .NET applications to **Azure** and exploring how to leverage **Azure App Service** and the **Azure SDK for .NET** to optimize, modernize, and scale applications for the cloud. Miho is proficient in **C#**, **ASP.NET**, and **Entity Framework** and is well-versed in cloud-based development practices but still relatively new to Azure’s ecosystem and its full suite of tools.

### Skills:
- **Programming Languages**: C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET, SQL
- **Frameworks**: .NET Framework, .NET Core, Entity Framework, ASP.NET MVC
- **Tools**: Visual Studio, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions
- **Cloud Platforms**: Microsoft Azure (Azure App Service, Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database)

### Motivations:
- **Cloud Migration**: Miho is eager to modernize legacy .NET applications by migrating them to Azure’s cloud services, leveraging features such as automatic scaling, high availability, and enhanced security.
- **Integration with Azure SDK**: Miho is particularly motivated to integrate Azure services like **Azure App Service**, **Azure Blob Storage**, and **Azure SQL Database** into existing .NET applications using the **Azure SDK for .NET**.
- **Optimize Performance**: Miho aims to take full advantage of Azure’s cloud capabilities to improve application performance, resilience, and scalability.

## Goals and Challenges:

### Objectives:
1. **Migrate On-Premises .NET Applications to Azure**: Miho is focused on migrating large-scale .NET applications from on-premises environments to **Azure App Service** while minimizing downtime and ensuring a smooth transition.
2. **Leverage Azure SDK for .NET**: Miho wants to use the **Azure SDK for .NET** to integrate Azure services such as **Azure Blob Storage**, **Azure SQL Database**, and **Azure Key Vault** into migrated applications, streamlining development and maintenance.
3. **Automate CI/CD with Azure DevOps**: Miho aims to set up robust CI/CD pipelines using **Azure DevOps** and **GitHub Actions** to automate the deployment and updates of .NET applications in Azure.

### Challenges:
1. **Optimizing Legacy Applications for the Cloud**: Miho faces challenges in refactoring and optimizing legacy .NET applications to fully utilize the benefits of Azure, such as **scalability**, **security**, and **cost management**.
2. **Azure-Specific Development**: Although Miho is proficient with .NET development, navigating the Azure ecosystem, particularly the **Azure SDK for .NET**, requires learning Azure-specific services, APIs, and best practices.
3. **Balancing Cloud Costs and Performance**: Miho is learning to strike a balance between optimizing application performance in the cloud and managing associated costs, especially for compute and storage resources in **Azure App Service** and **Azure SQL Database**.

## Basic Scenarios:

1. **Migrate a .NET Application to Azure App Service**: Miho will perform a migration of a large on-premises ASP.NET web application to **Azure App Service**, ensuring minimal downtime and leveraging automatic scaling and load balancing features.
   
2. **Integrate Azure Blob Storage for File Handling**: Miho will use the **Azure SDK for .NET** to integrate **Azure Blob Storage** into an existing .NET application to handle file uploads and downloads securely, replacing on-premises file storage solutions.

3. **Set Up CI/CD for .NET Apps with Azure DevOps**: Miho will configure a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using **Azure DevOps** and GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment of a .NET Core application to Azure.

---

## Advanced Scenarios:

1. **Optimize a Legacy .NET Application for Azure App Service**: Miho will refactor a monolithic legacy .NET application to take advantage of cloud-native features, such as decoupling components into microservices and enabling autoscaling using **Azure App Service**.

2. **Secure Azure-Based .NET Applications with Azure Key Vault**: Miho will integrate **Azure Key Vault** to securely manage and access secrets, such as database credentials and API keys, in a .NET application hosted on Azure.

3. **Utilize Azure SQL Database with the Azure SDK for .NET**: Miho will use the **Azure SDK for .NET** to connect a .NET application to **Azure SQL Database**, implementing secure authentication, querying, and database management features to scale the application’s data layer.
