# Dev Responsible For UWP Migration Persona

## Bio

"Taylor" is a developer who has been maintaining UWP apps for the past three years that are supported on various devices, including PCs, Xbox, and IoT devices. Taylor has been asked to migrate all of her company's UWP apps to a more modern framework.

## Goals and challenges

Taylor is trying to decide what framework to update the multiple UWP apps that she has been maintaining for her company so that the apps can benefit from a modern look, using the Fluent Design System, security enhancements, and features, specifically having been asked to incorporate the Windows Ink feature.

Taylor works in the Game industry and most of her company's apps are lightweight games that the company uses to sell and run advertisements on.

Taylor has been receiving complaints about the outdated look and poor performance speeds of her company's game apps. Taylor is concerned about the lack of active development for UWP apps and has determined that migration to a more modern framework is necessary. She is hoping to find clear guidance to help her determine which framework to update the UWPs apps to, as well as step-by-step how-to for transitioning the existing code.

Taylor is most familiar with C# and XAML, but is interested in trying new things and growing her developer skillset. She works on a Windows device.
