# Dev Responsible For UWP Migration Persona

## Bio

"Taylor" is a developer who has been maintaining UWP apps for the past three years that are supported on various devices, including PCs, Xbox, and IoT devices. Taylor has been asked to migrate all of her company's UWP apps to a more modern framework.

## Goals and challenges

Taylor is trying to decide what framework to update the multiple UWP apps that she has been maintaining for her company so that the apps can benefit from a modern look, using the Fluent Design System, security enhancements, and features, specifically having been asked to incorporate the Windows Ink feature.

Taylor works in the Game industry and most of her company's apps are lightweight games that the company uses to sell and run advertisements on.

Taylor has been receiving complaints about the outdated look and poor performance speeds of her company's game apps. Taylor is concerned about the lack of active development for UWP apps and has determined that migration to a more modern framework is necessary. She is hoping to find clear guidance to help her determine which framework to update the UWPs apps to, as well as step-by-step how-to for transitioning the existing code.

Taylor is most familiar with C# and XAML, but is interested in trying new things and growing her developer skillset. She works on a Windows device.

## Basic scenarios

1. Taylor needs to understand which platforms are supported by WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK if she ports the UWP games to WinUI using the .NET Upgrade Assistant. She is unsure if the games will be supported on Xbox and IoT devices.
2. Taylor wants to know what other frameworks are available for migrating or recreating the UWP games so they will support Windows, Xbox, and IoT devices. She would like would like to understand the features and benefits of each framework and how well they fit her current skillset.
3. The team would like to find the best learning resources for the chosen framework so that they can quickly get up to speed and start migrating the UWP games. They would like to know where to find the best documentation, tutorials, and samples for the chosen framework.
