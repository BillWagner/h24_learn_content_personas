# Learn Content Persona Scratchpad


## Project goals

* Develop a process to implement AI Personas (AIP) in the form of prompts for Copilot / ChatGPT based LLM systems.
* Using these AI Personas:
  * Allow a Content Developer to confirm their content is good, by asking the AIP (or multiple AIPs) to review it.
  * Show how a Content Developer can use the AIP to determin a set of key scenarios a real-world developer would want.
  * Use the AIP to review existing content to make sure the key scenarios can be achieved with existing content, and if not, suggest new content.
