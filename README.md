# h24_learn_content_personas
Hackathon 24 project


## Goals

Create a process for a Content Developer to feel confident they have tools to test their content against a persona that represents their target audience.
The results of the test should highlight any areas in the docs that need improvement.


## Hackathon 

1. Collect useful persona descriptions for content creators on the Learn team.
2. Create a templated version of the personas suitable for use in a ChatGPT prompt.
3. Create a series of example prompts to match specific tasks
4. Wrap it all up into a process that can be included in the Contributors' Guide

## Example of the process
