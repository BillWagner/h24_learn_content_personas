# h24_learn_content_personas
Hackathon 24 project



## Goals

Create a process for a Content Developer to feel confident they have tools to test their content against an AIP (AI persona) that represents their target audience.
The results of the test should highlight any areas in the docs that need improvement.

## Scenarios

1. A writer is working on topics for a new feature area. They use information from the feature owners to make a list of key scenarios and then create their docs.
Using the AIP (AI Persona) they confirm if, given the personas skillset and knowledge, they can achieve their goals with the new documentation.

2. A writer notices a lot of feedback centered around a certain area in the docs. Clearly something is not clear, or something is missing. They share the docs with the AIP, and query them to determine which areas need more work. They make changes to the content, and then re-test it with the AIP and check the number of feedback tickets to confirm their changes have been useful.


## Hackathon 

1. Collect useful persona descriptions for content creators on the Learn team.
2. Create a templated version of the personas suitable for use in a ChatGPT prompt.
3. Create a series of example prompts to match specific tasks
4. Wrap it all up into a process that can be included in the Contributors' Guide

## Example of the process

1. Decide which feature area you want to test with your AI developer persona.
2. Create a list of the key scenarios you want your developer to be able to achieve.

(ToDo: Provide guidance for writers on how to present these scenarios.)

3. Select the persona or personas you are targeting with your content.

4. Take the provided prompts, and fine tune them.
5. Test your content with the prompts and check the results for actionable feedback.
